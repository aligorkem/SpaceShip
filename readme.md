<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Build a simple application that displays a collection of Star Wars starships and allows the user to “favourite” the starships that appeal to them.<br>

Requirements <br>
• Fetch a single page of data from the following API: https://swapi.dev/api/starships/ <br>
• Display the collection of starships. On this screen present 2+ properties for each<br>
• Allow the user to click on a starship to view more details about it. <br>
• Users should be able to “favourite” starships from both screens. Don’t worry about<br>
• persistence across sessions (DB/SharedPrefs/etc); in-memory is fine. However
• consider that the solution might be extended in the future to support this.<br>
• Use any third-party libraries to help with your implementation<br>
• Concise, understandable code. Try not to over-engineer, however the solution should be maintainable and production ready.<br>
• Document any UX/UI/architecture/requirements assumptions<br>
